# Lumora-UI – Clarity Engine

Where tradition meets technology. Lumora UI is a clarity engine — an accessibility‑first, ethical UI framework for inclusive, mobile‑first web components. We design with the wisdom of the past and the vision of tomorrow.

## What is Lumora?

Lumora is a collection of thoughtfully crafted React components built with Tailwind CSS. Each element honors time‑tested design patterns while embracing modern web standards for accessibility, responsiveness and ethical design.

## Philosophy

- **Accessibility First:** Our components respect users of all abilities.
